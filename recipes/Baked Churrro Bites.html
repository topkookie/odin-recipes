    <H1>Baked Churros Bites Recipe</H1>
    <img src="../images/churro.jpg" alt="churro" height="350" width="350">
    <p>I’m not a very skeptical person in general, but whenever I hear about a baked version of a recipe that’s usually deep-fried,
         and they say it’s, “just as good, if not better,” I simply don’t believe it. And, that’s because it’s never true. 
        But, every once in a while, the results are so close that we can forgive a little bit of hyperbole, 
        and these baked churros are a great example.</p>
    <p>No, they don’t have the same crispy, crusty exterior the fried version features, b
            ut what they do have is pretty much everything else. 
            The interior texture, and flavor are virtually identical; 
            and if you use a star tip to pipe them, so is the appearance.
             Plus, they’re both perfect dipped into thick, rich, Spanish-style 
             hot chocolate, which may be the most important similarity.</p>
    <p>You hear people say that churro dough is identical to the ubiquitous “pate choux,” but I don’t agree. 
        If you do use that classic French dough, you’ll get something that’s lighter, eggier, and much more hollow. So, 
        I’ve tweaked the proportions to get something a little denser, and I think closer to a “real” churro. By the way, 
        stay tuned for the Spanish-style hot chocolate, 
        which will be the next video. But, no matter how you decide to enjoy yours, 
        I really hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 packed tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter for brushing on before sugaring</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cinnamon Sugar:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. 
            Add flour all at once and cook, 
            stirring, until a soft, sticky dough ball forms, and a starchy film coats the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking for about 1 minute more, scraping the film off the bottom of the pan as you stir. 
            You won’t have a clean bottom surface, but some will be reabsorbed by the dough.</li>
        <li>Add in vanilla extract and eggs, 1 at a time, 
            and mix in using a spatula. The mixture will separate at first, but eventually it will smear together into a sticky dough.</li>
    </ol>
