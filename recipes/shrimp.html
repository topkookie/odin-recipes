            <p>These fried shrimp have just the right amount of crunch
                 thanks to the panko bread crumbs. 
                If desired, serve with Kikkoman Tonkatsu Sauce for dipping.
            </p>

        <h1>Directions</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Beat eggs in a second medium bowl until frothy. Place bread crumbs in a third bowl.</li>
                    <li>Dredge shrimp in the flour mixture, then shake off excess. Dip shrimp into beaten eggs, then press shrimp into bread crumbs, turning to coat both sides.</li>

                    <li>Deep-fry shrimp in batches in the hot oil until cooked through, about 1 minute. Use tongs to transfer shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to cook remaining shrimp.</li>
                    <li>Arrange shrimp on a platter to serve.</li>
